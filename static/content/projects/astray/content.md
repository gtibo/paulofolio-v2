## Concept build-up

The concept for this game emerged out of a week of research and brainstorming for the graduate project. I wanted to create something where I could focus my skills on developing an immersive narrative and an environment for the player to wander. I knew I was limited, being alone on the project so I wanted to keep this singleplayer with no NPCs. The story unveils through the player character’s speech or logs. I had a few scenarios in my mind, all exploring isolated or abandoned places.

The narrative for this game mostly came from the interest I have in science-fiction pieces and space exploration. For a long time, I wanted to tell a story that would convey the emotion of being stranded alone in space. The tagline of the iconic Ridley Scott’s Alien: “In space, no one can hear you scream.” was one of the main inspirations. No need for a monster to chase you though, there was a dormant terror as the environment of space was dark and hostile.
